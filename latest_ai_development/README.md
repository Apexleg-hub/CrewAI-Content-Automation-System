# Latest AI Development – CrewAI Content Automation System

An autonomous multi-agent content creation system built with **CrewAI** that researches the latest AI developments and transforms them into a complete, multi-channel content campaign.

This project simulates a **digital media team** made up of AI agents that collaborate to produce research reports, written content, visuals, multimedia assets, and a unified campaign strategy.

---

## What This Project Does

This CrewAI system automatically:

1. **Researches** the latest developments in AI
2. **Creates content strategies** from the research
3. **Produces visual content ideas**
4. **Designs multimedia concepts** (video/audio)
5. **Combines everything into a full campaign**

It functions like an **AI marketing and media department** working together in sequence.

## Workflow Pipeline

The system runs in a **sequential process**, where each task builds on the previous one:

```
AI Research
   ↓
Content Strategy
   ↓
Visual Content Ideas
   ↓
Multimedia Concepts
   ↓
Campaign Integration
```

Each agent receives context from earlier tasks, allowing for intelligent collaboration.
